Technologies Used

How It Works
The game initializes with 16 cards (8 pairs of emojis) shuffled randomly.
Click a card to flip it. Click a second card to check for a match.
If they match, they stay flipped and your score increases.
If not, they flip back after a short delay.
The game locks input during animations to prevent rapid clicking.
Win when all pairs are matched.

Enjoy the game! 🎮
